- Two batteries of 5.4Ah and 7.2V nominalvoltage are taken for charging and discharging.
- The step time is fixed to 4s. Initial  SOC is fixed as 80% for charging battery and 100% for discharging battery.
- After the simulation, the SOC of charging battery increases to 80.4% and SOC of discharging battery decreases to 99.6%

The picture shows the simulated model of the system.
