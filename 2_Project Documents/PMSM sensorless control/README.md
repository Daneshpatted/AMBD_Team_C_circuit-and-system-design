|HLR_1|to move from stationary axis to rotational axis|
|HLR_2|come up with equations required to build the model and building the equations model in simulink|


Low Level requirements
|ID|Description|
|-----|-----|
|LLR_1.1|to make use of clark transform to move from abc axis to alpha and bheta axis|
|LLR_1.2|to make use of park transform to move from alpha and bheta axis to d-q axis|





|HLR1 |  To come up with equivalent circuit equations of motor|
|LLR1   To understand the equivalent circuit diagram using basic components|


|LLR2  |    To come up with equivalent circuit equations using electrical laws|




|HLR2 |   To model the motor using various equations obtained from circuit diagram|



|LLR1   |To find various parameters like speed ,torque,current and thereby estimate the position of the rotor.|
