# STATE OF CHARGE CONTROL OF LITHIUM ION BATTERY
## REQUIREMENTS

## ABSTRACT
    To propose a solution for the control of the state-of-charge of a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cell. The aim is to design a control scheme able to charge the battery in a fast way and without violating the battery safety constraints on the different electrochemical parameters of the electrochemical model (ECheM) of the battery. The proposed solution is based on a computationally efficient formulation of the reference governor (RG) which has been designed on the basis of a reduced equivalent-hydraulic model (EHM) of the ECheM. Using appropriate suitable safety margins, the satisfaction of the constraints on the EHM ensures the satisfaction of the constraints of the ECheM. Simulation results obtained on an accurate simulator show that the proposed method, if compared with classical charge strategies, is able to considerably increase the charge performance while ensuring the satisfaction of the constraints. 
    
## INTRODUCTION
   The estimation of battery state of charge (SoC) has been a topic of high interest in recent literature because it allows the available energy in the batteries and that which can still be stored to be identified. Therefore, it is the main indicator of the system state and its knowledge allows the system security level to be increased (avoiding overcharge and over-discharge situations) and the success rate of optimization algorithms oriented to the maximum performance exploitation to be improved  SoC estimation methods are classified in [4] as direct methods (such as open circuit voltage estimation, Coulomb counting, and electrochemical impedance methods) and indirect methods (such as those based on artificial intelligence, adaptive filters, and models . The advantages and disadvantages of the different methods and the related open issues are also analyzed. Among them, the main problems are related to the estimation algorithmâ€™s computational cost and not zero-mean error noises, due, for example, to measurement sensors drifting or non-correct modeling of the  phenomenon.
