# Modelling And Simulation Of 3Ph Voltage Source Inverter
##  Description
 ### Power electronics and electrical machines nowadays offer an extremely wide range of industrial applications. Their modeling and simulation are also a great interest to engineers and scientists. In some simulation applications, nonlinear of the power electronic devices is neglected due to its simplicity. Therefore, the performance of the control system obtained is not the same as experimental results. In this paper, a model of two-level three-phase voltage source inverter having its voltage drops is proposed. The proposed inverter was tested with RL load using space vector pulse width modulation and direct torque control of three-phase induction motors
